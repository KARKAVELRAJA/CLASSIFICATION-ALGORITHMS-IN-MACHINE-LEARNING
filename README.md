# CLASSIFICATION-ALGORITHMS-IN-MACHINE-LEARNING

### DETECTING THE BREAST CANCER USING THE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING

- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING the pre-processed data are Trained and the Accuracy Score is calculated
- Finally, Based on the Accuracy Score of Different Classification Models, the Model with MAXIMUM ACCURACY SCORE is selected for training and testing this dataset to get Maximum Precision
